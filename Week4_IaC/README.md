# üìÖ Week 4 | Infrastructure as Code (Intermediate to Advanced)

## üéØ Internship Objectives
- Understand the concept of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.
- Learn and implement **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning.
- Learn **Ansible basics** for configuration management.
- Automate service deployment (Apache and Docker) using Ansible playbooks.
- Compare major IaC and configuration management tools: **Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform**.
- Document the complete workflow with screenshots and explanations.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Tasks Completed

1. **Terraform Installation and Configuration**  
   - Installed **Terraform** on the system.
   - Configured **AWS CLI** for authentication.
   - Verified setup using `terraform -v` and `aws configure`.

2. **EC2 Instance Deployment with Terraform**  
   - Wrote **Terraform scripts** to launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
   - Configured provider and resource blocks.
   - Used the following files:
     - `main.tf` ‚Üí EC2 instance definition.
   - Executed commands:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Verified EC2 instance on AWS console.

3. **Ansible Playbook for Apache Installation**  
   - Learned **Ansible basics** (inventory, YAML syntax, modules).
   - Wrote a playbook to:
     - Install **Apache web server** on a Linux machine.
     - Ensure the service is started and enabled.
   - Verified by accessing Apache default page in the browser.

4. **Docker Deployment Automation using Ansible**  
   - Wrote an Ansible playbook to:
     - Install **Docker** on the target system.
     - Pull and run a Docker container.
   - Verified container deployment and application access.

5. **Comparison of Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform**  
   - Created a detailed **document** explaining:
     - Each tool‚Äôs overview and primary use case.
     - Key differences between **IaC** and **Configuration Management**.
     - Comparison table for better understanding.
   - **File:** `docs/Ansible_Puppet_Chef_Terraform_Comparison.docx`
